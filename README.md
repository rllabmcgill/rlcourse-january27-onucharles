# Summary
* 'Bandit.py' and 'NonStationaryBandit.py' simulate a stationary and non stationary environment, respectively.
* 'Agent.py' defines an agent that may use either sample-averaging to estimate action-values or constant step size.

# To test
* run 'test_stationary_env.py' to test sample average value estimation in a stationary environment (search method is epsilon greedy. one can vary the value of epsilon)
* run 'test_nonstationary_env.py' to test the use of constant step size in non-stationary environment (search method is epsilon greedy as well)
